### Hi there welcome to my GitHub!👩‍💻

I am a Software Developer with a passion for React, Redux, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Ruby on Rails. I have always enjoyed exploring and growing my creative side in all walk of life.

I have fun learning new technologies and pushing myself to think critically while using them. When brainstorming ideas, the user experience is at the forefront of my thoughts as I strive to build an interface around that which would be most responive and intuitive for them.

I am currently learning Python to expand my knowledge.
